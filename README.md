#  DDoS Map Visualization



A real-time visualization of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks on a globe, using live data from Cloudflare and AbuseIPDB. The project uses a trained machine learning model to classify IPs and show their threat level.



---



## Features


- Real-time attack visualization on a 3D globe
- Cloudflare attack data integration
- AbuseIPDB threat scoring using ML model
- IP geolocation caching for faster performance
- Color-coded attack points based on threat level

## Setup \& API Keys


## 1. Clone the repository


	- git clone https://github.com/Shaurya-34/ddos-map.git

	- cd ddos-map



## 2. Install frontend dependencies

	- cd frontend

	- npm install



## 3.Install backend dependencies

	-cd ..

	-pip install -r requirements.txt


## 4. Create .env file

In the project root, create a .env file with the following keys:

	- CLOUDFLARE\_RADAR\_TOKEN=<your\_cloudflare\_token>

	- ABUSEIPDB\_API\_KEY=<your\_abuseipdb\_key>

	- IPINFO\_TOKEN=<your\_ipinfo\_token>




# (IMP) How to get the API keys:


## Cloudflare Radar Token (CLOUDFLARE\_RADAR\_TOKEN)

	1. Sign up for a Cloudflare account.
	2. Go to Cloudflare Radar API and generate a personal API token.
	3. Make sure it has permission to read attack data.



## AbuseIPDB API Key (ABUSEIPDB\_API\_KEY)

	1. Register at AbuseIPDB
	2. Verify your email and log in.
	3. Go to API Key pageÂ and copy your key.

## IPInfo Token (IPINFO\_TOKEN)
	1. Sign up at IPInfo.io
	2. After login, go to the API Access page to get your token.


# These keys are PRIVATE. DO NOT SHARE them PUBLICLY. 
  	- The .env file is ignored in Git by .gitignore.



# RUNNING THE PROJECT



### 1. Start the backend: 
	- uvicorn backend.main:app --reload


### 2. Start the frontend:

	cd frontend
 	npm run dev



### 3. Open your browser at
  http://localhost:3000 to view the globe.





## GeoLite Database

The project can optionally use the GeoLite2-Country.mmdb file for IP geolocation.

\- You can keep `data/geolite/GeoLite2-Country.mmdb` in the project for faster lookups.  
\- Make sure to respect the GeoLite2 license(data/geolite/LICENSE.txt).  
\- Alternatively, you can remove the `.mmdb` file and the project will fall back to IPInfo.io for geolocation.




## Machine Learning Model

- The model classifies IP addresses in real-time using AbuseIPDB scores and country codes.
- ip\_classifier.joblib and country\_encoder.joblib are included in ddos-map/backend/models.
- Training scripts are in ddos-map/model/ in case you want to retrain the model.

# IMP NOTES

- Keep data/ip\_cache.csv to speed up geolocation lookups.
- The ML model works without the training dataset, but keeping it allows retraining if needed.
- .env contains sensitive API keys and should never be pushed to Git.
